Hey, I'm Lester, a Rustacean building the Rust coding assistant at [Corust.ai](https://corust.ai). Always curious about how things work under the hood.

This is where I share learning notes, technical explorations, and reflections on building products that matter.

Find me on [Twitter](https://x.com/lesterli0) and [GitHub](https://github.com/lesterli).
